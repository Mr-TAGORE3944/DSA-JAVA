to find all paths from source to target:-
1-> make result list of list, make current list to maintain backtracking.
2-> we want to do dfs , current.add(element);
and check node == target, else {
    visit all node in graph[node] and call dfs to neighbour.
    after visiting all nodes. remove added current.add(node) for maintaining backtracking. 
}
